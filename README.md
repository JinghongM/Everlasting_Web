# Everlasting_Web
This is the project for Everlasting Wardrobe! Hope we guys could build this website successfully and learn from this.

Here is some ideas about how to design a good app. (If you guys heard about system design.) First of all, we should start our design from the user requirements, then the logic part, (how we design functions to provide services), after that, we can choose the database and data format to support those logic.

---------------------------

In our project, we designed tables in our database based on potential service. However, the data in databases should be well-structured data, but the data now we have is not suitable for using directly. Thus, after that, we could start to work on preparing data for database by [processing the raw data](#Processing data).

After that, we could work on design some algorithm used for [getting data from data base](#Build SQL queries).

For guys just start our project, there is [some resource](#Start our project).

-----------------------------

## Processing data
In this part, we hope to process the data to fit the data type in our data base.

As far as I know, most of us are taking intro to ml course. I think using numpy and pandas could be powerful tools to process data. I upload a jupyter file working on that process. You guys could continue work on that based on what I am working on.

## Build SQL queries
In a web application we should search the data that users want. That means, we should build queries according to information users provide to us. So in this part, we can design some functions, which should get users' data as input and then get the query as output.

------------------------------

## Start our project
For guys who are not familiar with github and database, I hope you could go through some tutorial about github.

You can find a lot of useful github tutorial by simply google "github tutorial", or there is a tutorial I learned.
```sh
https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
``` 

Because our web site is based on Ruby on Rails, so I find a tutorial about that.
