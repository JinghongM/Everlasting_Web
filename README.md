# Everlasting_Web
This is the project for Everlasting Wardrobe! Hope we guys could build this website successfully and learn from this.

Because our web site is based on Ruby on Rails, so I find a tutorial about that. 
```sh
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-examples.htm
```

Beside, I also find a small but interesting tutorial about git.
```sh
